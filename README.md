# Python Bank CLI Application

## Overview

Python Bank is a simple command-line interface (CLI) banking application built using Python. It allows users to manage their bank account by checking their balance, making deposits, and withdrawing funds, all within a user-friendly interface enhanced with color and styling.

This project demonstrates basic Python skills, including input handling, conditional statements, and loops. It also uses the colorama library to add color and style to the terminal output, making the user experience more engaging.

## Operation

Simply type 1, 2, 3 or 4 and press enter to select your desired menu option. You will then be prompted as to the next input. 

## Testing

I have manually tested the projet by doing the following:

- Pass code through Pep8 filter and confirm no errors.
- Test the input by inputting valid and invalid options.
- Tested in internal terminal and on Code Institute Heroku terminal. 

## Solved bugs 

- Syntax errors and indentation errors causing the program to not load correctly.
- Add 'return 0' to functions to prevent program crashing when invalid data is entered.

## Remaining bugs

No known bugs remaining.
